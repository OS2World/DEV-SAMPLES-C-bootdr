The code and makefile for this routine assume the IBM C Set/2 32 bit
compiler and Work Frame.   There is nothing specific to the IBM compiler
in the code, any 32 bit OS/2 C compiler can be used.

Note the size of the EXE file, according to IBM this will be fixed by
the time the compiler is formally released.

Any questions, please feel free to contact me directly.
